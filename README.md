### ModelSuitableFor3DPrinter
Converting OBJ file to STL file, creating hollow 3D model with physical supporting structure for 3D printer.

### Objective
This  project  aims  to  investigate  techniques  to  convert  a  3D  mesh  model  into  cost-effective  model  for  3D  printing  and  develop  a  web-based  systemfor  the  conversion.  These  techniques  will  cover  geometry  processing,OBJ  file  manipulating  and  STL  file  generation.  The  web-based  systemshould  take  anOBJ  file  as  input,  evaluate  the  mesh  model,  generate  new  mesh  model  and  output  a  STL  file  for  3D  printing.
